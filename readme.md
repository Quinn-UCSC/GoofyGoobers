Welcome To MyTrueUCSC. Our website is a vibrant online platform dedicated to fostering connections and keeping you up-to-date with the latest happenings in the UCSC student community. By students, for students, our website's mission is to create a stronger, more united student body. This site is a group effort made by a group of 6 students for ART101 with Wes Modes in the spring of 2023. Navigation in this site is as easy as the click of a button, literally! Links are made easy and accessible by the strip listing "Club Events, Concerts, Parties, Discord, Student Art, Professor Ranks, External Links" below the automatic slideshow. You can also access the latest UCSC Club news through the embedded Twitter section on the homepage.
